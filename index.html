<h1>Starkissed</h2>
<p>Starkissed means being touched or blessed by the stars, and it’s often used to describe a feeling or moment that seems magical, gentle, and fated. It suggests a quiet, dreamy kind of love—one that feels safe, warm, and special, as if the universe itself is softly watching over it. In a poetic sense, starkissed captures the idea of emotional closeness and comfort, where two people share a connection that feels deeper than ordinary, like finding light and peace under the same night sky. 🌌✨</p>
<b>it feels special — like the universe quietly approved it 🌌🌟</b>
